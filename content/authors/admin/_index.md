I am a catchment ecologist, with a background in modelling and complex systems science. The broad aim of my research is to understand how the movement of energy and matter in landscapes shapes ecosystems in face of climate change, with water as the main vector of connectivity. More specifically, I am interested in landscape patterns of carbon and nutrient storage and flux, the biogeochemical mechanisms that regulate these patterns within and across ecosystems, and how to translate these processes across spatial and temporal scales to understand their broader implications. 

I graduated in Environmental Sciences in Barcelona university (Spain), which gave mesome knowledge about pressing environmental issues but I felt I lacked the tools. Therefore after graduating I went to the Mathematics department of the Autonomous University in Barcelona, and did an M.S in Modelling for Science, specialized in Statistical modelling and Complex Systems. My master thesis was about Multifractal patterns in boreal forests and how they mediate the response to fire dynamics. {{% staticref "files/Rocher-Ros_2014_The multifractal structure of ecosystems implications for the response of forest fires to environmental conditions.pdf" %}}Download the thesis here.{{% /staticref %}}

I did my PhD at Umeå University, with my thesis entitled "Biophysical controls on CO2 evasion from inland waters" and under the supervision of Reiner Giesler. I used fine scale measurements of landscape properties, together with temporal sensor data, to separate the role of physics in gas evasion from metabolic processes that affect the Carbon dynamics in aquatic systems. The "kappa" (in English would be "thesis cover") {{% staticref "files/Kappa.pdf" %}} can be found here. {{% /staticref %}}

My current postdoctoral research, funded by the Swedish Research council, consists in developing a Carbon processing model in streams networks, that I will complement with empirical observations across latitudinal and land cover gradients in Europe. Before that, I did a postdoc with Johan Olofsson and Ryan Sponseller also at Umeå university, focused broadly on the coupling between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems at high latitudes, and how multiple herbivores (reindeers, rodents and moths) mediate the export of carbon and nutrients to recipient aquatic systems. 

This website is pretty basic, where you can find publications, the CV, as well as some software tools I have been using for my research.
