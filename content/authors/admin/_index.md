I grew up in a small mountain valley in Catalonia, Spain, and from my village I could see how the major glacier of the Pyrenees, grand and snowy white when I was a kid, shrank and became grey as I got older. Then I became highly interested in biogeochemical cycles and global change caused by humans.

I studied Environmental Sciences in Barcelona university. Then I had some knowledge about pressing environmental issues but I felt I lacked the tools. Therefore after graduating I went to the Mathematics department of the Autonomous University in Barcelona, and did an M.S in Modelling for Science, specialized in Statistical modelling and Complex Systems. My master thesis was about Multifractal patterns in boreal forests and how they mediate the response to fire dynamics. {{% staticref "files/Rocher-Ros_2014_The multifractal structure of ecosystems implications for the response of forest fires to environmental conditions.pdf" %}}Download the thesis here.{{% /staticref %}}

I finished my PhD in 2019 at Umeå University, with my thesis entitled "Biophysical controls on CO2 evasion from inland waters" and under the supervision of Reiner Giesler. I used fine scale measurements of landscape properties, together with temporal sensor data, to separate the role of physics in gas evasion from metabolic processes that affect the Carbon dynamics in aquatic systems. The "kappa" (in English would be "thesis cover") {{% staticref "files/Kappa.pdf" %}} can be found here. {{% /staticref %}}

Now I'm doing a postdoc with Johan Olofsson and Ryan Sponseller also at Umeå university, focused on the effects of large scale reindeer grazing on nutrients and carbon fluxes from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystems.
