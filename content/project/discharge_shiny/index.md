App developed in Shiny to measure discharge in streams using a slug injection.

This app is intended to measure discharge using a slug injection of salt, it requires data recorded with a HoBo conductivity logger, a correction coefficient of the response of conductivity against NaCl and the exact amount of salt injected.

The version 2 is to use with another method: by adding a measured volume of salt solution in water, with a known conductivity.

Developed by G. Rocher-Ros (2016), for internal use at Ume√• University. Any third party use is under the users' responsability. For any questions contact gerardrocher (at) gmail (dot) com
