abstract = "Global warming is enhancing the mobilization of organic carbon (C) from Arctic soils into streams, where it can be mineralized to CO<sub>2</sub> and released to the atmosphere. Abiotic photo‐oxidation might drive C mineralization, but this process has not been quantitatively integrated with biological processes that also influence CO<sub>2</sub> dynamics in aquatic ecosystems. We measured CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations and the isotopic composition of dissolved inorganic C (δ<sup>13</sup>C-DIC) at diel resolution in two Arctic streams, and coupled this with whole‐system metabolism estimates to assess the effect of biotic and abiotic processes on stream C dynamics. CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations consistently decreased from night to day, a pattern counter to the hypothesis that photo‐oxidation is the dominant source of CO<sub>2</sub>. Instead, the observed decrease in CO<sub>2</sub> during daytime was explained by photosynthetic rates, which were strongly correlated with diurnal changes in δ<sup>13</sup>C-DIC values. However, on days when modeled photosynthetic rates were near zero, there was still a significant diel change in δ<sup>13</sup>C-DIC values, suggesting that metabolic estimates are partly masked by O<sub>2</sub> consumption from photo‐oxidation. Our results suggest that 6–12 mmol CO<sub>2</sub>‐C m−2 d−1 may be generated from photo‐oxidation, a range that corresponds well to previous laboratory measurements. Moreover, ecosystem respiration rates were 10 times greater than published photo‐oxidation rates for these Arctic streams, and accounted for 33–80% of total CO<sub>2</sub> evasion. Our results suggest that metabolic activity is the dominant process for CO<sub>2</sub> production in Arctic streams. Thus, future aquatic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions may depend on how biotic processes respond to the ongoing environmental change."

Abiotic photo‐oxidation might drive C mineralization, but this process has not been quantitatively integrated with biological processes that also influence CO2 dynamics in aquatic ecosystems. Photosynthetic and respiration rates were higher than photo-oxidation, driving the general CO2 dynamics in permafrost streams in Alaska. "
