abstract = "CO<sub>2</sub> evasion from freshwater lakes is an important component of the carbon cycle. However, the relative contribution from different lake sizes may vary, since several parameters underlying CO<sub>2</sub> flux are size dependent. Here we estimated the annual lake CO<sub>2</sub>  evasion from a catchment in northern Sweden encompassing about 30,000 differently sized lakes. We show that areal CO<sub>2</sub>  fluxes decreased rapidly with lake size, but this was counteracted by the greater overall coverage of larger lakes. As a result, total efflux increased with lake size and the single largest lake in the catchment dominated the CO<sub>2</sub> evasion (53% of all CO<sub>2</sub>  evaded). By contrast, the contribution from the smallest ponds (about 27,000) was minor (<6%). Our results emphasize the importance of accounting for both CO<sub>2</sub> flux rates and areal contribution of various sized lakes in assessments of CO<sub>2</sub> evasion at the landscape scale."
abstract_short = "We explore the drivers of CO<sub>2</sub> evasion across a large range of lake sizes. The two key factors (CO<sub>2</sub> and turbulence) scale with lake size in opposite directions, therefore the interactions of these factors is critical to estimate gas evasion. We find that large lakes are the main source of CO<sub>2</sub> at a landscape level. "
