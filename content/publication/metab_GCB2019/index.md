abstract = "Streams play an important role in the global carbon (C) cycle, accounting for a large portion of CO<sub>2</sub> evaded from inland waters despite their small areal coverage. However, the relative importance of different terrestrial and aquatic processes driving CO<sub>2</sub> production and evasion from streams remains poorly understood. In this study, we measured O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> continuously in streams draining tundra‐dominated catchments in northern Sweden, during the summers of 2015 and 2016. From this, we estimated daily metabolic rates and CO<sub>2</sub> evasion simultaneously and thus provide insight into the role of stream metabolism as a driver of C dynamics in Arctic streams. Our results show that aquatic biological processes regulate CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations and evasion at multiple timescales. Photosynthesis caused CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations to decrease by as much as 900 ppm during the day, with the magnitude of this diel variation being strongest at the low‐turbulence streams. Diel patterns in CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations in turn influenced evasion, with up to 45% higher rates at night. Throughout the summer, CO<sub>2</sub> evasion was sustained by aquatic ecosystem respiration, which was one order of magnitude higher than gross primary production. Furthermore, in most cases, the contribution of stream respiration exceeded CO<sub>2</sub> evasion, suggesting that some stream reaches serve as net sources of CO<sub>2</sub>, thus creating longitudinal heterogeneity in C production and loss within this stream network. Overall, our results provide the first link between stream metabolism and CO<sub>2</sub> evasion in the Arctic and demonstrate that stream metabolic processes are key drivers of the transformation and fate of terrestrial organic matter exported from these landscapes."
